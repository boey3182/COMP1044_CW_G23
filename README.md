Group 23 Database and Interfaces Coursework 2

1) A very good morning/afternoon/night I bid to my lecturers, to fully test our webpage, please first create a new database in myphpadmin, and then import our sql file named "library.sql"

2) Next, download all the php files into the htdocs file located within the xampp folder, as we are running it through a localhost.

3) Thank you and have a nice day! :D
